## Experiments in Unified Hetergeneous AI-ML-DL -> Libraries in a Microservices world!

Here's the story, AI is broad field with infinite opportunities, techniques, methods and so on.  In order to make all this accessible, those in the innovation field need a framework that supports pipelines of these methods and techniques readable callable with transforms embedded.  

Currently, the problem space is tightly coupled to the method and algorithm by the specificity of the data representation and the pre-processing requirements to get a computationally feasible result set.

This project will use problem solving in three specific domains to build a hetergeneous pipeline of AI-ML-DL algorithms and then define a framework that supports the execution-validation of that pipeline

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kllawson/experiments-ml/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
